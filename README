A classic (berlin definition) roguelike video game written with Bevy and inspired by modern ttrpg games.

Maleficer looks to balance procedural generation with buildcrafting, provide mechanical clarity (rules work like a tabletop game), and innovate the turn-by-turn gameplay loop.

Inspiration:
  Tresspasser
  Magic the Gathering (spells, resource system)
  Pillars of Eternity (stats)

Players take on the role of an ambitious magic school drop-out looking to [steal the amulet of yendor, or w.e].
At character creation, the player can select 1-2 magical disciplines, more are available via loot.

Example Magical Disciplines:
  * pyromancy
  * battle magic (gish)
  * illusion
  * teleportation
  * info gathering

## Design Questions
* If no hunger meter, how to prod the player to take risks?
* What is the progression system? (learning spells, stat system)
