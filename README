malefactor is intended to be a ttpg-inspired roguelike written in rust.

It takes heavy inspiration from games like Trespassor, bringing modern ttrpg dungeon crawling mechanics to the roguelike genre

# Ideas
characters are all some variant of wizard, and start with two schools.
The options are something like:
	* one per element
	* battle magic
	* teleportation/forced movement
	* defense
	* stealth
	* info gathering
Leveling up grants spells from the chosen schools, but more can be learned.

Going with spells because I don't want the combat loop to be about repeatedly making default attacks
