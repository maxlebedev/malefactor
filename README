Maleficer is intended to be a ttpg-inspired roguelike written in rust.

It takes heavy inspiration from games like Trespassor, bringing modern ttrpg dungeon crawling mechanics to the roguelike genre

# Ideas
characters are all some variant of wizard, and start with two schools.
The options are something like:
	* one per element
	* battle magic
	* teleportation/forced movement
	* defense
	* illusion/stealth
	* info gathering
Leveling up grants spells from the chosen schools, but more can be learned.

Might use a mana sytem at first, but maybe something more involved going forward? Like a stat for magic reserves, magnitude, duration, etc

Going with spells because I don't want the combat loop to be about repeatedly making default attacks


# TODO:

## Core gameplay
* Tests
* Spells, rather than items/scrolls
* Hotbar/Easy way to cast spells
* Chapter 66 has spell content, so work up to that first

## UX
* Descriptions next to inventory items

## Design
* Why explore the level, (vs doing down asap)
* What is the progression system?

## Bugs
